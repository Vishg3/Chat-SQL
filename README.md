# Chat-SQL

Streamlit app that allows users to interact with a SQL database, either a local SQLite3 database or a remote MySQL database. Users can input their database credentials and Groq API key to chat with the database through a Groq-powered agent. The app uses LangChain to configure the database, create an SQL agent, and process user queries. The agent interacts with the database and provides responses, with the conversation history stored and displayed for the user.
